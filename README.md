# Disaster Tweet classification using NLP
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify tweets as real disaster-related or not. 
The dataset consists of 10,000 manually labeled tweets. The NLP pipeline includes preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization),
feature engineering (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, word embeddings), and modeling.
Data visualization techniques such as histograms, count plots, and word clouds help explore trends. 
Text embeddings (Word2Vec, Sentence Transformers) enhance feature representation, while cosine similarity measures textual relationships. 
Finally, CountVectorizer is used for numerical representation of text data, optimizing it for machine learning models.

Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, string, re, gensim, sentence_transformers, sklearn, wordcloud
